# üçµ Gossip Command Implementation Plan

## **Project Overview**
Implement `/content gossip` command - a social intelligence feature that analyzes user relationships, behavioral patterns, and social dynamics to provide entertaining, personalized insights distinct from the newsletter system.

## **Core Distinction**
- **Newsletter**: "What happened?" (Event reporting)
- **Gossip**: "What does this mean for relationships?" (Social intelligence)

## **Implementation Details** üîß

### **Command Structure**
```python
@app_commands.command(name="gossip", description="Get social insights and relationship analysis")
@app_commands.describe(
    gossip_type="Type of social analysis to perform",
    about_user="Focus on specific user (optional)",
    focus="Specific aspect to analyze",
    style="Tone and presentation style",
    privacy_level="Who can see this analysis"
)
@app_commands.choices(gossip_type=[
    app_commands.Choice(name="Social Profile", value="social_profile"),
    app_commands.Choice(name="Relationship Analysis", value="relationship_analysis"),
    app_commands.Choice(name="Hidden Patterns", value="hidden_patterns"),
    app_commands.Choice(name="Social Predictions", value="predictions"),
    app_commands.Choice(name="Social Experiments", value="social_experiments")
])
```

### **Data Analysis Pipeline**
1. **Message Collection** - Gather from source channel(s) within timeframe
2. **Privacy Filtering** - Remove opted-out users and sensitive content
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Analyze interactions, reactions, timing patterns
4. **Social Mapping** - Build relationship networks and communication flows  
5. **Insight Generation** - AI creates engaging social narratives
6. **Privacy Review** - Final anonymization and content check
7. **Delivery** - Send to output channel with appropriate styling

### **Privacy Architecture**
- **Opt-out Database Table** - Track users who don't want to be included
- **Content Filters** - Exclude arguments, personal conflicts, sensitive topics
- **Anonymization Levels** - Full names, partial anonymity, or complete anonymity
- **Admin Controls** - Server-level gossip settings and restrictions
