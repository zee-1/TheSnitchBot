# Use best practices

# Use the PEP-8 standards


# Workflow

Can Never be skipped:
- Use git for version control, you can never avoid them
- never make new files, without trying to use all the files. When necessary tell me the reason why you want this file.
- Always prefer Refactoring over Rewriting
- Before saying all tasks are complete, test whatever you have made
- Always prefer Test Driven Development
